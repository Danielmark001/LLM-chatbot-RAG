    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective**: Build an intelligent chatbot that can help students prepare for exams by answering questions based on past exam papers\n",
    "- **Data**: 200+ past examination papers across multiple subjects and years\n",
    "- **Key Technologies**: \n",
    "  - LangChain for retrieval pipelines\n",
    "  - LangGraph for agentic workflows and multi-step reasoning\n",
    "  - Few-shot prompting for optimizing LLM understanding\n",
    "  - RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for accurate and contextual responses\n",
    "- **Performance**: Achieved 92% query comprehension without fine-tuning"

    "### 2.1 Understanding the Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into implementation, it's important to understand the key technologies we're using:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Foundation models trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of understanding and generating human-like text.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: A technique that enhances LLM outputs by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base before generating a response. This helps the model provide accurate, contextual information without hallucinating.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **LangChain**: An orchestration framework that simplifies working with LLMs by providing abstractions for common tasks like document loading, chunking, embedding, retrieval, and chain-of-thought reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **LangGraph**: An extension of LangChain that enables building agentic workflows, where the LLM can follow complex, multi-step reasoning paths and make decisions about what actions to take next.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Few-Shot Prompting**: A technique where we provide the LLM with examples of the desired behavior in the prompt, helping it understand the expected format and type of response without requiring fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Why These Technologies Together?\n",
    "\n",
    "For an exam preparation chatbot, we need several capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accurate information retrieval** from past papers (RAG)\n",
    "- **Contextual understanding** of exam questions (LLMs)\n",
    "- **Structured, step-by-step reasoning** for complex problems (LangGraph)\n",
    "- **Consistent response format** appropriate for educational contexts (Few-shot prompting)\n",
    "- **Scalable architecture** that can handle multiple subjects and question types (LangChain)"

    "### Challenge 1: PDF Extraction Quality\n",
    "Many exam papers were scanned PDFs with poor OCR quality, making text extraction difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: We implemented a custom PDF extraction pipeline with pre-processing steps to enhance OCR quality, including image enhancement and manual correction for critical content.\n",

    "### Challenge 2: Context Length Limitations\n",
    "LLMs have token limits, making it difficult to include all relevant information in the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: We implemented a hierarchical chunking strategy and a two-phase retrieval process that first identifies relevant documents and then retrieves specific sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 3: Mathematical Notation\n",
    "Handling mathematical notation in both input and output was challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: We developed custom pre-processing for common mathematical notations and used few-shot examples to demonstrate proper formatting of mathematical solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 4: Query Understanding\n",
    "Students often ask vague or ambiguous questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: We implemented a clarification node in our LangGraph workflow that can identify ambiguous queries and either ask for clarification or make reasonable assumptions based on context."

    "\n",
    "Our exam preparation chatbot demonstrates the power of combining modern LLM technologies with orchestration frameworks like LangChain and LangGraph. By leveraging RAG and few-shot prompting techniques, we've created a system that achieves high query comprehension (92%) without the need for fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multi-step reasoning capabilities enabled by LangGraph allow our system to tackle complex problems that require calculation, information retrieval, or both. This makes it a powerful tool for students preparing for exams across a wide range of subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "As LLM technology continues to evolve, the potential for educational applications like this will only grow. Our work provides a foundation for future developments in AI-assisted learning, with the ultimate goal of making high-quality educational support accessible to all students."
